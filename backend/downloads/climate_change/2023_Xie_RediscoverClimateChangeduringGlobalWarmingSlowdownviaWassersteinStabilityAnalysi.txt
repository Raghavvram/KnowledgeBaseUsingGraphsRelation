## Abstract
Climate change is one of the key topics in climate science. However, previous research has predominantly concentrated on changes in mean values, and few research examines changes in Probability Distribution Function (PDF). In this study, a novel method called Wasserstein Stability Analysis (WSA) is developed to identify PDF changes, especially the extreme event shift and non-linear physical value constraint variation in climate change. WSA is applied to 21st-century warming slowdown period and is compared with traditional mean-value trend analysis. The result indicates that despite no significant trend, the central-eastern Pacific experienced a decline in hot extremes and an increase in cold extremes, indicating a La Nina-like temperature shift. Further analysis at two Arctic locations suggests sea ice severely restricts the hot extremes of surface air temperature. This impact is diminishing as sea ice melts. Overall, based on detecting PDF changes, WSA is a useful method for re-discovering climate change.
