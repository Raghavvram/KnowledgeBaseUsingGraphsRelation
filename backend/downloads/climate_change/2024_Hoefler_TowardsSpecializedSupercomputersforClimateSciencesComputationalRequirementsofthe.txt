## Abstract
We discuss the computational challenges and requirements for high-resolution climate simulations using the Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic Weather and Climate Model (ICON). We define a detailed requirements model for ICON which emphasizes the need for specialized supercomputers to accurately predict climate change impacts and extreme weather events. Based on the requirements model, we outline computational demands for km-scale simulations, and suggests machine learning techniques to enhance model accuracy and efficiency. Our findings aim to guide the design of future supercomputers for advanced climate science.
