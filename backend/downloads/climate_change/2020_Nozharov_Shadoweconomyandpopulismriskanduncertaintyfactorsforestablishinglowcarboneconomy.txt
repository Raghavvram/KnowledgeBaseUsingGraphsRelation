## Abstract
The main purpose of the current publication is to formulate a scenario model for analysis of the opportunities for low-carbon economy establishment in the countries with transition economies.The model studies risk factors such as shadow economy level and populism based on the implementation and development of Balkan countries economic policy and at the same time shows future climate changes tendencies and uncertainties of climate models.A transdisciplinary approach is implemented in the study. Climate change perception and understanding about low-carbon economy are examined through the public opinion and analysis of mass-media publications.The results of the research are important in order to clarify the multicultural divergences as a factor for risk and uncertainty in the implementation process of the policy for climate change.In this way geographical aspects of risk and uncertainty, which are not only related to the economic development of the relevant countries, could be brought out.
