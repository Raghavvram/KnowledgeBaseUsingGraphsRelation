## Abstract
Extreme weather events stemming from climate change can cause significant damage and disruption to power systems. Failure to mitigate and adapt to climate change and its cascading effects can lead to short and long term issues. The profound costs of outage in power systems, integrated with the impacts on individual safety and security from loss of critical services, necessitate an urgent need to guarantee resilience in electric power systems. This article proposes a framework to optimize the electricity sector design to be more resilient to climate change and extreme weather events by using distributed generators. The proposed framework considers components dynamic behavior and interdependencies under an uncertain environment. The climate data and socio economic factors are used to generate demand and supply pattern scenarios. The generated scenarios are simulated and utilized in a stochastic optimization model to find the optimal resilience based system design.
