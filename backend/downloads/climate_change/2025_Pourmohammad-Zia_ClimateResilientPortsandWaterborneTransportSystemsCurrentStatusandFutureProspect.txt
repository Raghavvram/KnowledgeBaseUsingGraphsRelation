## Abstract
The increasing challenges posed by climate change necessitate a comprehensive examination of the resilience of waterborne transport systems. This paper explores the nexus of climate resilience, and waterborne transport, addressing the challenges faced by ports and their connecting waterborne transport systems. It provides an in-depth analysis of the current status of climate-resilient infrastructure and operations while emphasizing the transformative potential of emerging technologies. Through a systematic review, the paper identifies critical gaps and opportunities. Research predominantly emphasizes port infrastructure over supply chain resilience, neglecting the interconnected vulnerabilities of maritime networks. There is limited focus on specific climate-induced disruptions, such as drought and compounded events, which complicate resilience planning. Methodologically, risk assessments and case studies dominate the field, while advanced technologies such as digital twins, artificial intelligence, and satellite monitoring remain underutilized. Geographic disparities in research output and a tendency toward short- to medium-term planning further constrain global and long-term resilience efforts. To address these gaps, the study advocates for systems-based approaches that integrate infrastructure, operations, and supply chains. It highlights collaborative frameworks and advanced tools, including digital twins, machine learning, and participatory modeling, as crucial for enabling predictive and adaptive risk management. This study stands as one of the first comprehensive reviews exclusively focused on climate resilience in ports and waterborne transport systems. It provides actionable insights for policymakers, researchers, and industry stakeholders, proposing a future research agenda to advance waterborne transport systems capable of withstanding multifaceted climate impacts.
