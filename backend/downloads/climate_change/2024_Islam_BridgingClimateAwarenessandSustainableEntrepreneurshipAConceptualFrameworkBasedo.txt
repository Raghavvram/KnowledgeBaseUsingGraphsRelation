## Abstract
Many studies have examined the connection between the intention to start a business and environmental values. However, there still needs to be more knowledge in the extant literature about how climate change campaigns influence sustainable entrepreneurial intention. This study uses the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to develop a theoretical framework to explain how climate change campaigns affect the intention to start a sustainable business. This interdisciplinary conceptual research model bridges the gap between climate awareness, sustainable values, and entrepreneurial intentions, offering a robust framework for understanding and fostering sustainable entrepreneurial behaviors. Our study lays the groundwork for future empirical studies and real-world interventions to advance sustainability through entrepreneurship.
